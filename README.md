# Football_Visualization
<p>In this project, we will be strengthening our data visualization skills by creating different plots such as Bar plots, Line Graphs, Pie Charts, Cluster Plots etc. These plots will be used to check various patterns and trends in football events such as goals scored or matches won. These visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.</p>
